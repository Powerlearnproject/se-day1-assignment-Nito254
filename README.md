#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering refers to the procedural design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software systems. 
It enables us to use structured methodologies, tools, and best practices to create reliable, scalable, and efficient software solutions.
Software engineering drives innovation by powering applications in AI, cloud computing, IoT, which facilitate the continuity and development of technology.
It also improves efficiency by automating tasks and optimization thus streamlining business processes and helping to save on time and cut on costs. 
It enhances security through the creation of reliable security systems which  help to protect data and systems from any vulnerabilities or attacks.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The Software Crisis (1960s-1970s): During this era, early software projects often failed due to poor planning, leading to cost overruns and bugs and this consequently led to the formalization of software engineering as a discipline.
Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s): During this era, modularity was introduced with concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Agile & DevOps (2000s-Present): This is where the great shift from rigid (Waterfall) development methodology to iterative (Agile) development methodology took place. DevOps integrated development and operations were introduced for faster and continuous delivery.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning: Feasibility tests and budget approximation are done to calculate the amount of resources that should be allocated to the project. 
Analysis: This is where requirement and risk analysis is done to evaluate the viability of the software development project.
Design: This is where the system architecture and prototypes are drawn/created.
Implementation: Here is where writing, compilation and debugging of lines of code takes place.
Testing: The functionality of the system is analysed and verified and errors that may be present are corrected at this stage.
Deployment: The system is released into the market/to the intended clients for use.
Maintenance: Fixing of bugs and frequent updating of the system's features to ensure it maintains optimum performance is done here. Also, new features are added during this stage to ensure it stays relevant in the constantly changing software environment/market.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology is done in linear, sequential phases while agile methodologiy uses iterative, incremental sprints.
Waterfall methodology is rigid, i.e it does not easily allow changes/ changes are costly, while agile methodology is adaptable to changing requirements.
Waterall methodoloy is most appropriate for well-defined projects with a fixed design, e.g Banking Systems, while agile methodology is suitable for projects with fast-changing requirements, e.g web apps or startups.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A software Developer carries out the task of creating blueprints and prototypes for a required system and later writing lines of code to actually design it according to the given requirements/ specifications, i.e writing, debugging and maintaining code.
A quality Assurance Engineer tests the software for defects and ensures its quality.
A project Manager, works as an overseer of the whole project, supervising timelines, budgets, and team coordination.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments help to streamline coding with debugging, auto-completion, and build tools, saving on time and costs. Examples include Visual Studio and IntelliJ.
Version Control Sytems tracks changes in code, enable collaboration, and prevent code conflicts. Examples include, Git and SVN.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Constantly changing project requirements during the development process causing the need for modifications. This can be solved by using agile methodology during software development since it is adaptable to changing requirements.
Inability to collaborate easily on projects requiring teams. This can be fixed by using VCS and communication tools e.g Slack.
Poor code quality. This can be fixed by encouraging and implementing code reviews and regular testing.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing- This is where an individual component of the system is tested for its functionality. Helps to simplify debugging processes by localising failures through catching bugs early in development.
Integration Testing- This is testing done to ensure different modules of a system work together to give optimum output. Helps to detect interface defects and ensure subsystems collaborate as expected.
System Testing- Where testing is done on the overall system to check its performance and validate it. Ensures compliance with business and technical specs.
Acceptance testing- Testing to confirm whether the systems meets the users'/business needs. Determines if the software is ready for production and aligns development with real-world needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective, detailed inputs to guide AI models to give quality desired outputs.
It improves response accuracy and reduces irrelevant or incorrect answers.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Give me examples of hardwood trees and the time they take to grow.
Name for me five types of hardwood trees, give me their characteristics in bullet points and tell me the time taken(in years) for each type of tree to grow to maturity.
It provides a more accurate specification of the information we need to obtain, and ensures that the output is presented in a structured, concise manner.
